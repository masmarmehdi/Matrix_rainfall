# Matrix_rainfall
This is a matrix rain in which i've used the ncurses library for having this matrix rainfall.
i used the make file so. we don't need to compile each and every function manually .
Usage of this code is : usage: ./matrix_rain [-s]; 
-s is for making the matrix instantly without waiting for the phrases to be done , however you can just write ./matrix_rain and see the phrases.
If you want to change the color of the matrix rain you can just choose a number from 1 to 7:
1 - Green.
2 - White.
3 - Yellow.
4 - Blue.
5 - Magenta.
6 - Cyan.
7 - Red.
Also if you wanna quit the matrix you can do it by clicking on 'q' key.
